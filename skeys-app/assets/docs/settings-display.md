# Display Settings

## Overview

The Display tab allows you to customize the visual appearance of SKeys for better readability and comfort.

## Theme

Choose your preferred color theme for the application.

### Available Themes

- **System**: Follows your desktop environment's theme. If your system is set to dark mode, SKeys will use dark mode automatically.
- **Light**: Always use the light color scheme with a bright background.
- **Dark**: Always use the dark color scheme with a dark background.

### When to Use Each

| Theme | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| System | Seamless integration with your desktop |
| Light | Bright environments, daytime use |
| Dark | Low-light environments, reducing eye strain |

Changes take effect immediately.

## Text Size

Adjust the text size throughout the application for better readability. This affects all text in lists, dialogs, buttons, and menus.

### Available Sizes

- **Small** (85%): Compact view, fits more content on screen
- **Normal** (100%): Default size, balanced readability
- **Large** (115%): Easier to read, recommended for larger displays
- **Extra Large** (130%): Maximum readability, ideal for accessibility needs

### Important Notes

- **Large text sizes may cause layout overflow** in some dialogs. If you experience issues, select "Normal" to reset.
- Icons and monospace fonts (SSH keys, fingerprints) are not affected by text scaling.
- Text scaling works independently from your system's display scaling settings.

### Preview

As you select different text sizes, a preview shows how text will appear at that size. Changes take effect immediately throughout the app.

## Tips

- If you find yourself squinting or leaning closer to the screen, try a larger text size
- On high-resolution displays, larger text sizes often improve comfort
- The setting is saved automatically and persists between sessions
